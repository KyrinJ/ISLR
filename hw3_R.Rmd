## Exercise 1

![Sketch of typical curves.](D:/Ex3.7_1.png)

Null hypotheses:
H01 (Intercept)£ºwith given TV, radio and newspaper, the mean value of sales is 0.
H02 (TV): with given radio and newspaper, TV has no effect on sales.
H03 (radio): with given TV and newspaper, radio has no effect on sales.
H04 (newspaper): with given TV and radio, newspaper has no effect on sales.

Based on these p-values, it can be concluded that newspaper has no effect on sales and TV & radio have effect on sales.

## Exercise 2
KNN classifier is for classification  (discrete output), while
KNN regression methods is for continuous output.
The former is qualitative while the latter is quantitative.


## Exercise 3
(a)
iii is correct.
Because 
Salary(male) = 50 + 20 GPA + 0.07 IQ + 0.01 (GPA*IQ)
Salary(female) = 50 + 20 GPA + 0.07 IQ + 35 + 0.01 (GPA*IQ) - 10 GPA

For a fixed value of IQ and GPA, 

Salary(male) - Salary(female) = 10 GPA - 35,

so that males earn more on average than females provided that the GPA is high enough.

(b)
IQ = 110 and GPA = 4.0

Salary(female)=50+20*4+0.07*110+35+0.01*4*110-10*4=137.1

(c)
False.

Whether there is evidence of an interaction effect between GPA/IQ is determined by the corresponding p-value rather than the value of coefficient.

## Exercise 4
(a)
Training RSS for the cubic regression would be lower than the training RSS for the linear regression.
Because a cubic regression would fit the noise, making training RSS lower.

(b)
Testing RSS for the linear regression would be lower than the training RSS for the cubic regression.
Because when the true relationship between X and Y is linear, overfitting of the cubic regression would increases testing RSS.

(c)
Training RSS for the cubic regression would be lower than the training RSS for the linear regression.
Because cubic regression with higher flexibility fits the data points better, thus having a lower training RSS. 

(d)
There is not enough information to tell.
Because we don't know how far it is from linear.
If the true relationship between X and Y is nearly linear, testing RSS for the linear regression would be lower.
If the true relationship between X and Y is highly non-linear, testing RSS for the cubic regression would be lower.
